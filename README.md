# Criminal Recognition and Identification System (CRISYS) - Summary

## Project Overview

The Criminal Recognition and Identification System (CRISYS) represents a breakthrough in law enforcement technology, utilizing artificial intelligence to transform textual descriptions of suspects into visual representations. This innovative system combines natural language processing (NLP) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create accurate facial images from witness descriptions.

## Core Technology

CRISYS leverages the Stable Diffusion model, a latent diffusion model initially trained on 512x512 images from the LAION-5B database. The system's architecture consists of three main components:
- **Autoencoder (VAE)**: Converts images into low-dimensional latent representations and vice versa
- **U-Net**: Predicts denoised image representations from noisy inputs
- **Text-encoder**: Transforms text prompts into embeddings that guide image generation

## Implementation Process

The implementation follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**

   - Utilized the FFHQ (Flickr-Faces-HQ) dataset from Kaggle
   - Preprocessed images for consistency in resolution and format
   - Applied data augmentation techniques to enhance diversity

2. **Prompt Processing**

   - Developed a systematic approach for converting detailed descriptions into structured prompts
   - Identified key facial features (face type, eye shape, hair style, etc.)
   - Created a condensation function to streamline descriptions into model-compatible format

3. **Image Generation**

   - Fed condensed prompts into the Stable Diffusion pipeline
   - Generated high-quality RGB images matching the descriptions
   - Utilized GPU acceleration for optimal performance


4. **Sketch Conversion**
   - Transformed RGB images into grayscale
   - Applied image inversion to enhance light and shadow
   - Used Gaussian blur for natural softness
   - Employed color dodge blending to create pencil sketch effect
   - Saved final sketches as high-quality PNG files
